# BBClean - Blackboard Cleanup

This Chrome browser plugin aims at removing some unnecessary content from Blackboard. It is currently optimised for the Blackboard of the TU Delft, but it can potentially be extended to support many more different Blackboard systems, and versions.

### What the plugin does currently:

- Moves the TU Delft (or other) logo next to the menu: reduces header by 42 pixels.
- Removes customisation header bar, as this is now drag and drop by default anyway, and who does really apply colours to his Blackboard? No one right?
- Moves ugly (!) vtbegenerated messages (the ones that look like they are from the 1992 internetz) to the right of the menu, so they are still visible but without the ugly style and less obtrusive.

Feedback and extensions are welcome!

### Installation instructions
Until we publish the plugin to the Chrome Web Store the installation process is as follows:

- [Download the zip file](https://github.com/hermanbanken/BBClean/archive/master.zip) containing the sources
- Extract the zip somewhere
- Go to the Chrome menu > More tools > Extensions
- Click the *Load unpacked extension...* button
- Select the folder (that is the extracted zip)
- Surf to Blackboard and enjoy!
